# Nemesis Linux

Nemesis Linux is a new independent Linux distribution, which aims to be unstable and retarded as possible. Nemesis Linux is based on musl libc, busybox userland. It's source-based, but i'm trying to make as many binary packages as possible.

What about init? I don't have idea what it should have as init. Package manager? Work in progress...

Approximate release date: May 2021.

With love from Russia!
